<p>When producing these photos I had to do some of them at a perticular time of day inorder to get the lighting I wanted to get. Edited these pictures took a little time removing defects that the clients wanted to have removed along with adjusting the lighting to make the picture pop out. For the formal picutures I was going for that romantic sun set feeling, where everything seems calm and peaceful. For the photo of the dog, I was trying to get the dog being in its natural envirment looking around. During the shooting sessions of these pictures I used a 18-55mm lens and I used a tripod for a few of them.</p>
